As shown in the table below, if mentorship is needed to be one on one, there are not nearly enough mentors to re staff Pewlett-Hackard. Even if each mentor takes on a much larger amount of new hires, there might not be enough. It might be possible to increase these numbers if, instead of having the birth year as a prerequisite, they included younger employees with adequate work experience. With the amount of new hires so high, the need for more mentors is necessary.
